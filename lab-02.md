### Exercise 1

The country of the highest plastic waste per capita is located in North
America. Overall, it seems like North America has more countries with
comparitively higher plastic waste per capita than other continents.

``` r
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)
) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  labs(x = "Plastic Waste Per Capita", y = "Count of Countries")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.

    ## Warning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_bin()`).
